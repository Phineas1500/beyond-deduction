[My current write-up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16rwSouWz1fovKkQWXqNsaBo9kIHMkrPkX38n25zWncU)

I started working on this project with three other students in Professor Abulhair Saparov's Fall 2025 NLP class (CS 577).

I took the work I completed on my own and wrote the above document. I submitted this to Neel Nanda's MATS 10.0 stream.

I have since done additional research into attention patterns and activation patching. I will soon release a blog about everything I've done.
