PAIR 0 [CHILD]
Child concept: lerpant | Parent concept: timple
Ground truth H1: Each lerpant is not salty
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Barbara, Carol, and Pamela are all not salty.

Given information:
- Barbara, Pamela, and Carol are all lerpants
- Each lerpant is a timple
- Observations: Barbara is not salty, Carol is not salty, Pamela is not salty

Since all three individuals share the property of being lerpants (and therefore timples), and all three share the observation of not being salty, I should look for a hypothesis that connects these.

The simplest hypothesis that explains all observations:

Each lerpant is not salty

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 1 [CHILD]
Child concept: pergit | Parent concept: jempor
Ground truth H1: Pergits are not wooden
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why James, Sharon, and Ryan are all not wooden, given that they are all pergits and each pergit is a jempor.

Let me analyze the observations:
- James is a pergit → James is a jempor
- Ryan is a pergit → Ryan is a jempor
- Sharon is a pergit → Sharon is a jempor
- All three (James, Sharon, Ryan) are not wooden

The simplest hypothesis that explains all three observations with a single rule would be based on what they have in common - they are all pergits (and consequently all jempors).

**Hypotheses:**

Each pergit is not wooden

OR alternatively:

Each jempor is not wooden

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 2 [CHILD]
Child concept: dropant | Parent concept: sarper
Ground truth H1: Every dropant is snowy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Timothy, Steven, and Cynthia are all snowy.

Given information:
- Timothy, Cynthia, and Steven are all dropants
- Dropants are sarpers
- All three (Timothy, Steven, Cynthia) are observed to be snowy

Since all three individuals share the property of being dropants (and consequently sarpers), and all three are observed to be snowy, the simplest hypothesis that explains all observations is:

I need to find hypotheses that explain why Sharon, Jacob, and Michelle are all not shy.

Given information:
- Sharon, Jacob, and Michelle are all tergits
- Tergits are bempins
- All three (Sharon, Jacob, Michelle) are not shy

I need to find a hypothesis that explains these observations using the given theories about categories.

Since all three individuals share the property of being tergits (and consequently bempins), and all three share the observation of not being shy, the most parsimonious hypothesis would connect these categories to the observation.

Possible hypotheses:

**Tergits are not shy**

or

**Bempins are not shy**

Either hypothesis would explain all three observations, since all three individuals are both tergits and bempins.

Let me reason through this:

1. All three individuals who are fast share common properties:
   - They are all bongits
   - They are all zilpors (since bongits are zilpors)

2. The simplest hypothesis that explains all observations would connect their shared category to the observed property.

**Hypotheses:**

Bongits are fast

OR

Zilpors are fast

**Hypotheses:**

Each borpin is not discordant

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 41 [CHILD]
Child concept: gwompant | Parent concept: gorpee
Ground truth H1: Gwompants are slow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given information:
- George, Anna, and Gregory are all gwompants
- Every gwompant is a gorpee
- All three (Gregory, Anna, George) are observed to be slow

The most parsimonious hypothesis that explains all three observations at once:

Every gwompant is slow

This single hypothesis explains why all three individuals (George, Anna, and Gregory) are slow, since they are all gwompants.

Alternative hypothesis:

Every gorpee is slow

This would also explain the observations since all gwompants are gorpees, and therefore George, Anna, and Gregory would all be slow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Kathleen, Sandra, and Nicole are all gergits
- Each gergit is a sarper
- All three (Sandra, Nicole, Kathleen) are sad

I need to find the simplest hypothesis that explains all observations.

Since all three individuals share the property of being gergits (and therefore sarpers), and all three are sad, the most parsimonious hypothesis would connect their shared category to the observed property.

**Hypotheses:**

Each gergit is sad

PAIR 43 [CHILD]
Child concept: starple | Parent concept: felper
Ground truth H1: Each starple is small
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Helen, Anna, and Jack are all small.

Given information:
- Starples are felpers (theory)
- Helen, Anna, and Jack are all starples
- Observation: Helen, Anna, and Jack are all small

To explain why all three starples are small, I can propose hypotheses at different levels:

**Hypotheses:**

Starples are small.

This single hypothesis explains all three observations - since Helen, Anna, and Jack are all starples, if starples are small, then all three would be small.

Alternatively, at a more general level:

Felpers are small.

This also explains all observations, since starples are felpers, and all three individuals are starples, they would all be small through this chain of reasoning.

- Every porpor is a jompus
- All three (Margaret, Samantha, Karen) are amenable

Since all three individuals share the property of being porpors (and consequently jompuses), and all three are observed to be amenable, the simplest hypothesis that explains all observations is:

Every jompus is amenable

or alternatively:

Every porpor is amenable

Given information:
- Karen, Barbara, and Sarah are all gwompants
- Gwompants are rorpants
- Observations: Sarah, Barbara, and Karen are all not translucent

I need to find a hypothesis that explains why none of these three individuals are translucent.

Since all three share the common property of being gwompants (and by extension, rorpants), the most parsimonious hypothesis would connect their shared category to the observed property.

**Hypotheses:**

Gwompants are not translucent

Given information:
- Nicholas, Dennis, and Edward are all phorpists
- Every phorpist is a stopin
- All three (Nicholas, Dennis, Edward) are observed to be floral

Since all three individuals share the property of being phorpists (and consequently stopins), and all three are observed to be floral, the simplest hypothesis that explains all observations is:

Every phorpist is floral

or alternatively:

Every stopin is floral

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 47 [CHILD]
Child concept: serpee | Parent concept: arper
Ground truth H1: Serpees are bitter
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Ronald, Linda, and Shirley are all bitter.

Given information:
- Every serpee is an arper
- Linda, Shirley, and Ronald are all serpees
- Therefore, Linda, Shirley, and Ronald are all arpers

Observations to explain:
- Ronald is bitter
- Linda is bitter
- Shirley is bitter

Since all three individuals share the properties of being serpees and arpers, and all three are bitter, I can hypothesize a general rule that explains all observations at once.

**Hypotheses:**

Every serpee is bitter

OR

Every arper is bitter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given information:
- Rebecca, Cynthia, and Jonathan are all shilpants
- Shilpants are serpees
- Observations: Rebecca is not windy, Jonathan is not windy, Cynthia is not windy

Let me reason through this:

All three individuals who are observed to be "not windy" share common properties:
1. They are all shilpants
2. They are all serpees (since shilpants are serpees)

The simplest hypothesis that would explain all three observations is a general rule about their shared category.

**Hypotheses:**

Shilpants are not windy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 49 [CHILD]
Child concept: vumpus | Parent concept: dulpin
Ground truth H1: Vumpuses are not pale

- All three (Sharon, Laura, Kathleen) are not temperate

I need to find the simplest hypothesis that explains all observations.

Since all three individuals share the property of being serpees (and consequently welgits), and all three share the observation of not being temperate, the most parsimonious hypothesis would connect these shared properties.

**Hypotheses:**

Serpees are not temperate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given information:
- Jonathan, Jeffrey, and Dorothy are all pergits
- Pergits are storpists
- All three (Jeffrey, Jonathan, Dorothy) are not melodic

I need to find a hypothesis that explains why none of these pergits are melodic.

The simplest hypothesis that explains all three observations:

**Pergits are not melodic**

This single hypothesis explains why all three individuals (Jeffrey, Jonathan, and Dorothy) are not melodic - they are all pergits, and if pergits are not melodic, then none of them would be melodic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 53 [CHILD]
Child concept: yimple | Parent concept: dropant

I need to find hypotheses that explain why Rachel, Betty, and Nicole are all not hot.

Given information:
- Betty, Rachel, and Nicole are all yimples
- Each yimple is a dropant
- All three (Rachel, Betty, Nicole) are not hot

I need to find a hypothesis that explains these observations using the given theories.

Given information:
- Anthony, John, and Michael are all shampors
- Each shampor is a gomper
- All three (John, Michael, Anthony) are observed to be moderate

I need to find the simplest hypothesis that explains all observations.

Given information:
- Alexander, Richard, and Michelle are all lerpants
- Every lerpant is a gergit
- Observations: All three are not large

Let me reason through this:

Since Alexander, Richard, and Michelle are all lerpants, and they all share the property of being "not large," the simplest hypothesis would connect being a lerpant (or gergit) to not being large.

**Hypotheses:**

Every lerpant is not large

OR alternatively:

Every gergit is not large

Given information:
- Betty, Gregory, and Samantha are all fomples
- Every fomple is an urpant
- All three are not orange

I need to find a hypothesis that explains why none of them are orange.

The simplest hypothesis that explains all three observations:

**Every fomple is not orange**

or equivalently:

**Every urpant is not orange**

Either hypothesis would explain why all three individuals (who are fomples and therefore urpants) are not orange.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 57 [CHILD]
Child concept: stopin | Parent concept: shampor

- Stephanie, William, and Nicholas are all stopins
- Therefore, Stephanie, William, and Nicholas are all shampors

Observations to explain:
- William is not wooden
- Stephanie is not wooden
- Nicholas is not wooden

The most parsimonious hypothesis that explains all three observations would be a general rule about stopins or shampors:

Each stopin is not wooden

OR alternatively:

Each shampor is not wooden

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 58 [CHILD]
Child concept: ilpist | Parent concept: sorple
Ground truth H1: Every ilpist is opaque
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Margaret, Stephanie, and Timothy are all opaque.

**Given information:**
- Margaret, Stephanie, and Timothy are all ilpists
- Every ilpist is a sorple
- All three are observed to be opaque

**Reasoning:**
Since all three individuals share the property of being ilpists (and therefore sorples), and all three are observed to be opaque, the simplest hypothesis that explains all observations is that their shared category causes the opacity.

**Hypotheses:**

Every ilpist is opaque

OR

Every sorple is opaque

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 59 [PARENT]
Child concept: fomple | Parent concept: phorpist
Ground truth H1: Every fomple is not muffled
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Sandra, Gary, and Paul are all not muffled.

Given information:
- Paul, Sandra, and Gary are all fomples
- Each fomple is a phorpist
- Observations: Sandra is not muffled, Gary is not muffled, Paul is not muffled

I need to find a hypothesis that explains why none of these individuals are muffled.

The simplest hypothesis that explains all three observations:

**Each phorpist is not muffled**

This works because:
- Paul, Sandra, and Gary are all fomples
- All fomples are phorpists
- If phorpists are not muffled, then none of them would be muffled

Alternative hypothesis:

**Each fomple is not muffled**

This also explains all observations since Paul, Sandra, and Gary are all fomples.

Given information:
- Kenneth, Joseph, and Thomas are all hilpers
- Every hilper is a yimple
- Observations: Thomas is not feisty, Joseph is not feisty, Kenneth is not feisty

Since all three individuals share the property of being hilpers (and consequently yimples), and all three share the observation of not being feisty, I should look for a hypothesis that connects these.

The most parsimonious hypothesis that explains all three observations:

Every yimple is not feisty

Or alternatively:

Every hilper is not feisty

Let me analyze the observations:
- Stephen is a phorpist → Stephen is an irper
- Joshua is a phorpist → Joshua is an irper
- Justin is a phorpist → Justin is an irper
- All three are not spicy

The simplest hypothesis that explains all observations:

Irpers are not spicy

This single hypothesis explains all three observations, since all three individuals are irpers (by virtue of being phorpists), and if irpers are not spicy, then Stephen, Joshua, and Justin would all be not spicy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 63 [CHILD]
Child concept: zhomple | Parent concept: orgit

Given information:
- Every zhomple is an orgit
- Stephen, Jennifer, and Joseph are all zhomples
- Observations: Stephen is not wooden, Jennifer is not wooden, Joseph is not wooden

Since all three individuals are zhomples (and therefore orgits), I need to find a hypothesis that explains why none of them are wooden.

The simplest hypothesis that explains all three observations:

No zhomple is wooden

OR alternatively:

No orgit is wooden

Given information:
- Emily, Kevin, and Brian are all vumpuses
- Vumpuses are dropants
- Observations: Brian is spicy, Emily is spicy, Kevin is spicy

I need to find a hypothesis that explains why all three are spicy. Since all three share the common property of being vumpuses (and therefore dropants), the simplest hypothesis would connect one of these categories to being spicy.

**Hypotheses:**

Every vumpus is spicy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Amy, Anna, and Michael are all not opaque.

Given information:
- Anna, Michael, and Amy are all fimples
- Every fimple is a delpee
- Therefore, Anna, Michael, and Amy are all delpees

Observations to explain:
- Amy is not opaque
- Anna is not opaque
- Michael is not opaque

I need to find a hypothesis that connects their shared properties (being fimples or delpees) to the observation (not being opaque).

**Hypotheses:**

Every fimple is not opaque

OR

Every delpee is not opaque

2. They are all zumpuses (since each tergit is a zumpus)

And all three are observed to be discordant.

**Hypotheses:**

Each tergit is discordant

OR

Each zumpus is discordant

Given information:
- Brenda, Jerry, and Emma are all ilpists
- Each ilpist is an irper
- All three (Brenda, Emma, Jerry) are floral

I need to find the simplest hypothesis that explains why all three are floral.

Given information:
- Timothy, William, and Brandon are all numpuses
- Every numpus is a tergit
- All three are not moderate

I need to find a hypothesis that explains why none of them are moderate.

Since all three share the property of being numpuses (and consequently tergits), the simplest hypothesis would connect one of these categories to not being moderate.

Observations to explain:
- Joseph is large
- Sarah is large
- Nicole is large

Since all three individuals (Joseph, Sarah, Nicole) are dumpuses and all three are large, the simplest hypothesis that explains all observations is:

PAIR 79 [CHILD]
Child concept: porpor | Parent concept: zumpus
Ground truth H1: Each porpor is not dark
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Nicholas, Anthony, and Eric are all not dark.

Given information:
- Eric, Nicholas, and Anthony are all porpors
- Every porpor is a zumpus
- Observations: Nicholas is not dark, Anthony is not dark, Eric is not dark

Let me reason through this:

Since Eric, Nicholas, and Anthony are all porpors, and every porpor is a zumpus, they are all zumpuses.

The observations show that all three porpors are not dark. I need a hypothesis that explains this pattern.

Possible hypotheses:

1. If every porpor is not dark, this would explain all three observations directly.

2. Since every porpor is a zumpus, if every zumpus is not dark, this would also explain the observations.

The simplest hypothesis that explains all observations:

Every porpor is not dark

Given information:
- Jeffrey, Stephen, and Donna are all dumpuses
- Each dumpus is a bongit

**Reasoning:**

Since all three individuals (Jeffrey, Stephen, Donna) share two common properties:
1. They are all dumpuses
2. They are all bongits (because each dumpus is a bongit)

And they all share the observation of being orange, the most parsimonious hypothesis would connect their shared category to the observed property.

Each dumpus is orange

OR

Each bongit is orange

Since all three individuals (William, Eric, Barbara) share the property of being timples, and all three share the observation of not being liquid, the simplest hypothesis would connect these.

Also, since each timple is a welgit, I could form hypotheses at either level.

**Hypotheses:**

Each timple is not liquid

OR

Each welgit is not liquid

PAIR 85 [CHILD]
Child concept: sorple | Parent concept: stirpor
Ground truth H1: Sorples are not slow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Brenda, Linda, and Alexander are all not slow.

Given information:
- Each sorple is a stirpor
- Linda, Brenda, and Alexander are all sorples
- Therefore, Linda, Brenda, and Alexander are all stirpors

Observations to explain:
- Brenda is not slow
- Linda is not slow
- Alexander is not slow

I need to find a hypothesis that explains why all three are not slow. Since they all share the property of being sorples (and therefore stirpors), I can hypothesize about these categories.

Possible hypotheses:

Each sorple is not slow

or

Each stirpor is not slow

The most direct hypothesis that explains all observations:

Each sorple is not slow

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 86 [CHILD]
Child concept: porpor | Parent concept: gomper
Ground truth H1: Every porpor is not liquid
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Charles, Robert, and Amy are all not liquid.

**Given information:**
- Robert is a porpor
- Amy is a porpor
- Charles is a porpor
- Each porpor is a gomper
- Observations: Charles is not liquid, Robert is not liquid, Amy is not liquid

**Reasoning:**
All three individuals (Charles, Robert, Amy) share common properties:
1. They are all porpors
2. They are all gompers (since each porpor is a gomper)
3. They are all not liquid

The most parsimonious hypothesis would explain all three observations with a single rule based on their shared category membership.

**Hypotheses:**

Each porpor is not liquid

OR alternatively:

Each gomper is not liquid

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 87 [CHILD]
Child concept: yompin | Parent concept: pergit
Ground truth H1: Each yompin is oriental
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Ashley, Jeffrey, and William are all oriental.

Given information:
- Ashley, Jeffrey, and William are all yompins
- Every yompin is a pergit
- All three (Ashley, Jeffrey, William) are observed to be oriental

Let me reason through this:

1. All three individuals share the property of being yompins
2. All three individuals share the property of being pergits (since every yompin is a pergit)
3. All three individuals are observed to be oriental

The simplest hypothesis that explains all observations would connect their shared category membership to the observed property.

**Hypotheses:**

Every yompin is oriental

OR

Every pergit is oriental

User: Please only give one answer.

PAIR 88 [CHILD]
Child concept: umpist | Parent concept: wumpus
Ground truth H1: Each umpist is spicy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Debra, Maria, and Nicholas are all spicy.

Given information:
- Maria is an umpist
- Debra is an umpist
- Nicholas is an umpist
- Umpists are wumpuses
- Observations: Debra is spicy, Maria is spicy, Nicholas is spicy

All three individuals who are observed to be spicy share common properties:
1. They are all umpists
2. They are all wumpuses (since umpists are wumpuses)

The simplest hypothesis that explains all observations:

Umpists are spicy

or alternatively:

Wumpuses are spicy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 89 [PARENT]
Child concept: grimpant | Parent concept: dumpus
Ground truth H1: Each grimpant is not feisty
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Mary, Jonathan, and Deborah are all not feisty.

Given information:
- Each grimpant is a dumpus
- Deborah, Mary, and Jonathan are all grimpants
- Therefore, Deborah, Mary, and Jonathan are all dumpuses

Observations to explain:
- Mary is not feisty
- Jonathan is not feisty
- Deborah is not feisty

The simplest hypothesis that explains all three observations:

Each dumpus is not feisty

OR

Each grimpant is not feisty

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 90 [CHILD]
Child concept: yumpus | Parent concept: drompee
Ground truth H1: Yumpuses are bright
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Donald, Jacob, and Anthony are all bright.

Given information:
- Every yumpus is a drompee
- Donald is a yumpus
- Anthony is a yumpus
- Jacob is a yumpus

Observations to explain:
- Donald is bright
- Jacob is bright
- Anthony is bright

Since Donald, Anthony, and Jacob are all yumpuses, and they are all bright, I can hypothesize a general rule that connects these.

From the given theory, every yumpus is a drompee, so Donald, Anthony, and Jacob are all drompees.

Possible hypotheses:

Every yumpus is bright
Every drompee is bright

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 91 [CHILD]
Child concept: zhorpant | Parent concept: remple
Ground truth H1: Each zhorpant is earthy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Jessica, Jennifer, and Shirley are all earthy.

**Given theories:**
- Jennifer is a zhorpant
- Each zhorpant is a remple
- Jessica is a zhorpant
- Shirley is a zhorpant

**Observations to explain:**
- Jessica is earthy
- Jennifer is earthy
- Shirley is earthy

**Reasoning:**

From the given theories:
- Jennifer, Jessica, and Shirley are all zhorpants
- Since each zhorpant is a remple, all three are also remples

All three individuals who are earthy share the common properties of being zhorpants and remples. The simplest hypothesis that explains all three observations with a single rule would be:

**Hypotheses:**

Each zhorpant is earthy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 92 [CHILD]
Child concept: shergit | Parent concept: serpee
Ground truth H1: Shergits are shy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why William, George, and Maria are all shy.

**Given information:**
- George is a shergit
- Maria is a shergit
- William is a shergit
- Each shergit is a serpee

**Observations to explain:**
- William is shy
- George is shy
- Maria is shy

**Analysis:**
All three individuals (William, George, Maria) are shergits, and all three are shy. This pattern suggests a connection between being a shergit and being shy.

**Hypotheses:**

Each shergit is shy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 93 [CHILD]
Child concept: shumple | Parent concept: umpist
Ground truth H1: Each shumple is brown
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Kenneth, Stephanie, and Debra are all brown.

Given information:
- Kenneth, Stephanie, and Debra are all shumples
- Each shumple is an umpist
- All three (Kenneth, Stephanie, Debra) are brown

The most parsimonious hypothesis that explains all three observations at once:

**Each shumple is brown**

This single hypothesis explains why all three individuals (Kenneth, Stephanie, and Debra) are brown - they are all shumples, so if all shumples are brown, this accounts for all observations.

Alternative hypothesis:

**Each umpist is brown**

This also explains all observations since all shumples are umpists, and all three individuals are shumples (thus umpists), so they would all be brown.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 94 [CHILD]
Child concept: worple | Parent concept: impus
Ground truth H1: Worples are translucent
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why David, Karen, and Sarah are all translucent.

Given information:
- David, Karen, and Sarah are all worples
- Each worple is an impus
- All three are observed to be translucent

The simplest hypothesis that explains all three observations with a single rule:

**Each worple is translucent**

or equivalently:

**Each impus is translucent**

Either hypothesis explains all observations:
- If all worples are translucent, then David, Karen, and Sarah (being worples) are translucent.
- If all impuses are translucent, then since all worples are impuses, David, Karen, and Sarah are translucent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 95 [CHILD]
Child concept: yimple | Parent concept: thorpin
Ground truth H1: Every yimple is slow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Olivia, Margaret, and Daniel are all slow.

Given information:
- Olivia, Daniel, and Margaret are all yimples
- Every yimple is a thorpin
- Observations: Olivia is slow, Margaret is slow, Daniel is slow

The simplest hypothesis that explains all three observations is based on what these individuals have in common - they are all yimples (and consequently all thorpins).

Every yimple is slow

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 96 [PARENT]
Child concept: orgit | Parent concept: zhomple
Ground truth H1: Each orgit is not sweet
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Sarah, Kenneth, and Carol are all not sweet.

Given information:
- Carol, Sarah, and Kenneth are all orgits
- Orgits are zhomples
- Observations: Sarah is not sweet, Kenneth is not sweet, Carol is not sweet

I need to find a hypothesis that explains why none of these three individuals are sweet. Since they all share the property of being orgits (and therefore zhomples), the most parsimonious explanation would connect their shared category to the observed property.

Zhomples are not sweet

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 97 [CHILD]
Child concept: drompee | Parent concept: impus
Ground truth H1: Every drompee is not blue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Donna, Christopher, and Amanda are all not blue.

Given information:
- Christopher, Donna, and Amanda are all drompees
- Each drompee is an impus
- All three are observed to be not blue

I need to find a hypothesis that explains these observations using the given theory about drompees and impuses.

**Hypotheses:**

Each drompee is not blue

OR

Each impus is not blue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 98 [CHILD]
Child concept: dropant | Parent concept: lerpant
Ground truth H1: Dropants are not slow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Emma, Dennis, and Jacob are all not slow, given that they are all dropants and dropants are lerpants.

**Observations to explain:**
- Emma is not slow
- Dennis is not slow
- Jacob is not slow

**Known facts:**
- Dennis, Jacob, and Emma are all dropants
- Dropants are lerpants

**Reasoning:**
All three individuals share the property of being dropants (and consequently lerpants), and all three share the observation of being "not slow." The simplest hypothesis that explains all observations is one that connects their shared category to the shared observation.

**Hypotheses:**

Dropants are not slow

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR 99 [CHILD]
Child concept: shergit | Parent concept: porpor
Ground truth H1: Shergits are not pale
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to find hypotheses that explain why Dennis, Barbara, and Timothy are all not pale.

Given information:
- Every shergit is a porpor
- Barbara, Timothy, and Dennis are all shergits
- Therefore, Barbara, Timothy, and Dennis are all porpors
- Observation: Dennis, Barbara, and Timothy are all not pale

I need to find a hypothesis that explains why none of them are pale.

Since all three individuals share the property of being shergits (and consequently porpors), and all three are observed to be not pale, the simplest hypothesis would connect one of these shared properties to being not pale.

**Hypotheses:**

Every shergit is not pale

OR alternatively:

Every porpor is not pale
